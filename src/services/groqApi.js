**EARLY ADVENTURES:**
[A dedicated section about their time in ${participantData.answers.location10} 10 years ago. Include specific details about this location and what they might have experienced there.]

**RECENT JOURNEY:**

**POWER STATS:**
- **Work Style:** [Work style]
- **Problem Solving:** [Problem solving approach]
- **Communication:** [Communication style]

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Do NOT create a superhero name or title - I will handle that part
2. Do NOT include any percentages in the profile
3. Do NOT add any introduction or conclusion - start directly with the ORIGIN STORY section
4. Keep it fun, positive, and professional
5. Focus on their actual role (${participantData.answers.role}) rather than inventing a superhero equivalent
6. VERY IMPORTANT: Create THREE SEPARATE LOCATION SECTIONS as outlined above (Origin Story, Early Adventures, Recent Journey) - each focusing on a different location from their history. Each section should be detailed enough to allow time for a map to be displayed during presentation.`;
